# Routing Strategy based on Routing Protocols
路由演算法及其策略

Typically when Routing Protocols are evaluated, it is on the basis of characterisics that somewhat from the overall design, such as 

1. Convergence Times

2. Protocol Overheads (=Capacity of Bandwidth)

3. CPU Utilization

4. Memory Utilization

5. Stability

6. Hierarchy

7. Redundancy
