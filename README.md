# Routing Strategy based on Routing Protocols
路由演算法及其策略

# Graphic of Architecture

(mix of IGP & Static)




      Static ---------  Rs ------- point to point ------- R --------- Static
                      (OSPF)                            (RIP)




# Chooses Basis

Typically when Routing Protocols are evaluated, it is on the basis of characterisics that somewhat from the overall design, such as 

1. Convergence Times

2. Protocol Overheads (=Capacity of Bandwidth)

3. CPU Utilization

4. Memory Utilization

5. Stability

6. Hierarchy (degrees of connectedness & sizes of network areas)

7. Redundancy (protection from service interruption, degree of service consitency)

# Choices of Strategies (Evaluation of Dynamic Routes) 

* BGP, Border Gateway Protocols-4 (EGP)

* RIP, Routing Information Protocol (IGP)

* OSPF, Open Shortest Path First Protocol (IGP)

# Static Routes Concept

While Routing Protocols are not needed, then use Static Routes. It is apply to tub area.
